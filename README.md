This school project is about solving four challenges that are playable using the hardware and setup instructions provided in the documentation folder. The hardware used is the following:

- Breadboard
- Nucleo F303RE Arduino board
- Potentiometer
- Whadda WPM461 module
- I2C Backpack
- LCD display 16x4 I2C
- 8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter
- Buzzer
- Some 220 Ohms resistors
- Some male-female jumper wires

In the documentation folder you can find all the information related to how to place the hardware and how to play the challenges. You can start the challenges by running the `main.ino` file after properly setting up the hardware, as described in the word document.
